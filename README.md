## Introduction
Two visualisation systems developed to answer different questions regarding Spotify songs of 6 genres (EDM, Latin, Pop, R&B, Rock, Rap). A further analysis of the systems can be done by design comparison, and user evaluation (feedback).


## Dataset
We have information of over 18K songs from spotify, with 12 audio features, for 6 genres (EDM, Latin, Pop, R&B, Rock, Rap). More information on the dataset can be found here: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-01-21/readme.md

## Output
The two visualisation systems developed can be directly accessed with the HTML files in the repository -
